# ‚òï ParlaBot: potrebbe ripeterlo?  
<em>(SpeakBot: Could you repeat that?)</em>

ParlaBot is a voice-enabled app that gives you real-time feedback on your Italian pronunciation. Speak into your mic, and ParlaBot will transcribe what you said, compare it to a target phrase, and return constructive feedback ‚Äî powered by modern open-source AI and traditional DSP filtering techniques.

### First, a Nod to the Past

My first real speech recognition project was my 2007 Master‚Äôs thesis ‚Äî a vowel recognition frontend built using [FFTs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform), [Mel filters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mel-frequency_cepstrum), and [CMU Sphinx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMU_Sphinx). It‚Äôs old-school compared to today‚Äôs AI toolkits, but this research (not necessarily mine, but those I studied) laid the foundation for the models that power ParlaBot.

### Fast-Forward to Now

Nearly two decades later, I‚Äôve been studying Italian seriously for three years and wanted to build something that merges:

- Revisiting of my past studies in speech recognition  
- Hands-on exploration of modern STT and AI toolkits  
- My passion for learning Italian  

**Entrare il ParlaBot**  
(*Enter ParlaBot*)

## Project Goals

- Build a practical voice-powered Italian pronunciation coach  
- Showcase my ability to design, develop, and deploy AI-based microservices  
- Reinforce skills in Python, Go, C/C++, and container-based architecture  
- Deliver a self-contained, demo-ready application in **2‚Äì3 weeks**

---

## Architecture Overview

ParlaBot is composed of several Dockerized microservices:

1. **Frontend UI [React]**  
   - Displays the target phrase from the PhraseService  
   - Records mic input and sends audio to the Orchestrator  
   - Displays multiple transcriptions and feedback  

2. **API Orchestrator [Go (Gin)]**  
   - Exposes a `/transcribe` endpoint  
   - Forwards the user‚Äôs audio to multiple STT pipelines concurrently using goroutines  
   - (Planned) Routes results to the Feedback service  

3. **STT Service [Python (FastAPI) + HuggingFace Transformers + C++ Filters]**  
   - Accepts `.wav` audio  
   - Applies optional preprocessing via C++ filters  
   - Transcribes speech using `wav2vec2-large-xlsr-53-italian`  
   - Returns the model, preprocessing info, and transcript  

4. **Phrase Service [Python (FastAPI) + MongoDB + TTS]**  
   - Serves target phrases and audio  
   - (Planned) Tracks user progress  

5. **Feedback Service (TBD)**  
   - Compares STT output with the target phrase  
   - Returns phonetic or semantic similarity  

All services are containerized and connected via `docker-compose`.

## Roadmap

| Component         | Status       | Notes |
|------------------|--------------|-------|
| **React UI**      | ‚úÖ Working     | Audio input, transcription display, waveforms/playback need refining |
| **Go API**        | ‚úÖ Working     | Will be refactored as more STT pipelines and feedback are added |
| **STT Service**   | ‚úÖ WIP         | Needs cleanup filters, support for more models |
| **Phrase Service**| ‚úÖ Working     | Needs more sample phrases |
| **Feedback Svc**  | ‚ùå Not started| Will compute similarity between STT and target |
| **Kong**          | üü° Optional   | Would like to explore, not required |
| **Deployment**    | üü° Planning   | Targeting Fly.io, DO, or AWS |
